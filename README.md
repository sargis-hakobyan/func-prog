Functional programming (FP) is popular direction now, and a lot of programmers want to learn it. But it is not an easy thing. From my experience I can say that reading articles about FP is not enough. Code samples, simple ones, with explanations are most wanted for learning but unfortunately that is not easy to find them :). 

I met enthusiastic guys, who has the same problem. We decided to learn and share our experience in different programming languages such as JavaScript, Scala, Haskell in order to help beginners.
